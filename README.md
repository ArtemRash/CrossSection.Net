# CrossSection.Net
CrossSection.Net is a C# package for the analysis of arbitrary cross-sections using finite elements. This project is based on a python package written by Robbie van Leeuwen https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/section-properties. CrossSection.Net uses Triangle.NET for section triangulation https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=triangle and MathNet https://numerics.mathdotnet.com for matrix operations.
